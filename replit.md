  - **Independent Analysis First**: AI runs initial classification without any YOLO influence for unbiased assessment
  - **YOLO Detection Second**: YOLO wound detection provides additional context with confidence scores and measurements
  - **AI Reconsideration**: AI reassesses original classification considering YOLO findings and explains reasoning changes
  - **Transparency Display**: Detection card shows both independent and YOLO-influenced classifications side by side
  - **Confidence Tracking**: System tracks confidence changes and displays whether YOLO increased or decreased AI confidence
  - **Authentic AI Reasoning**: Mimics human expert workflow where specialist considers additional test results to refine diagnosis
