# ‚ö° **Wound Care AI: Question Integration for Prompt Templates**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Structured Data Collection**

Your app should collect these inputs (via form, API, or dialogue):

| Field             | Example                                                     | Notes                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `woundOrigin`     | "Pressure ulcer from prolonged sitting, noticed 3 days ago" | How + when wound started          |
| `medicalHistory`  | "Type 2 diabetes, smoker, on prednisone"                    | Key comorbidities / meds          |
| `woundChanges`    | "Increased redness, foul odor, more drainage today"         | Indicates progression, infection? |
| `currentCare`     | "Changing dressing daily with gauze, using OTC ointment"    | Current practices                 |
| `woundPain`       | "Constant burning pain, 6/10"                               | Pain character + intensity        |
| `supportAtHome`   | "Has caregiver help"                                        | Social context (optional)         |
| `mobilityStatus`  | "Limited mobility, wheelchair user"                         | (optional)                        |
| `nutritionStatus` | "Low appetite, recent 10-lb weight loss"                    | (optional)                        |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Prompt Template Example**

Here‚Äôs a **dynamic prompt template** that can live in `prompts/templates.ts`:

```ts
export function buildWoundPrompt(data: {
  woundOrigin: string,
  medicalHistory: string,
  woundChanges: string,
  currentCare: string,
  woundPain: string,
  supportAtHome?: string,
  mobilityStatus?: string,
  nutritionStatus?: string,
  audience: "family" | "patient" | "medical"
}) {
  return `
You are a wound care specialist AI. Generate a detailed, audience-appropriate wound care plan. 
Audience: ${data.audience}

Wound background:
- How/when it occurred: ${data.woundOrigin}
- Medical history: ${data.medicalHistory}
- Noticed changes: ${data.woundChanges}
- Current care: ${data.currentCare}
- Pain description: ${data.woundPain}
${data.supportAtHome ? `- Support at home: ${data.supportAtHome}` : ""}
${data.mobilityStatus ? `- Mobility: ${data.mobilityStatus}` : ""}
${data.nutritionStatus ? `- Nutrition: ${data.nutritionStatus}` : ""}

The plan should:
- Use language appropriate for the audience
- Include cleaning method, dressing type, change frequency
- Explain warning signs that need urgent medical attention
- Be safe, evidence-based, and clear

Add a reminder: "Consult a healthcare professional before following this plan."
`;
}
```

‚úÖ **Audience-Adaptive**: This lets the model adjust language and detail level automatically.

‚úÖ **Extensible**: You can easily add more factors later (e.g. allergies, previous wound history).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **How This Helps AI Output**

‚û° The model gets:

* Clear context to avoid generic plans.
* Insight into potential complications (e.g. diabetes + infection).
* Ability to tailor to social situation (e.g. caregiver support).

‚û° Your app:

* Can log exactly what was fed into the model for traceability.
* Easily adjust prompts without changing core logic.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Next Steps**

If you'd like, I can:
üëâ Draft the **starter TypeScript code** for this prompt builder function.
üëâ Create **sample payloads + model API calls** with this template.
üëâ Write test cases to validate prompt correctness.

Would you like to proceed with any of these? üöÄ
