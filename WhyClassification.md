## Case: 2025-07-10-762
**User:** sampilling@higharc.com  
**Date:** 7/10/2025, 6:47:18 AM  
**Wound Type:** Surgical Wound  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound is a dehisced (opened) surgical incision site. The wound edges are not approximated and are macerated in some areas. There is significant swelling (edema) of the limb. The wound bed is covered in a mix of yellow slough, areas of red granulation tissue, and some active bleeding.

### Classification Process:

**Independent Classification:** Surgical Wound (95% confidence)  

**YOLO Status:** Disabled  

**Final Decision:** AI classified as Surgical Wound with 95% confidence

## Case: 2025-07-10-530
**User:** sampilling@higharc.com  
**Date:** 7/10/2025, 6:56:39 AM  
**Wound Type:** Traumatic Wound  
**Confidence:** 85%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound presents as a complex healing traumatic injury, possibly an abrasion or a burn. It has a large, adherent, dark scab or eschar covering most of the surface. The edges show signs of healing with new pink and white epithelial tissue forming. There is some redness (erythema) around the perimeter, which could indicate inflammation or a localized infection.

**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound appears to be a healing skin graft or a complex repaired laceration. There are remnants of sutures visible. The wound bed has a mixed appearance with areas of both healthy healing tissue (epithelialization) and non-viable tissue (necrosis/scab), which may indicate a component of delayed healing.

**Wound Type:** diabetic foot ulcer  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound presents as a deep, full-thickness ulcer with well-defined, 'punched-out' edges. There is significant hyperkeratosis (callus) surrounding the wound perimeter. The wound bed is predominantly red, indicating granulation tissue, with a small amount of white, stringy slough or potentially exposed tendon. The surrounding skin appears dry.

**Wound Type:** diabetic foot ulcer  
**Confidence:** 90%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound presents with a classic 'punched-out' appearance surrounded by a thick rim of hyperkeratosis (callus). The wound bed is mostly red granulation tissue, with a small amount of white, stringy tissue visible, which could be slough or exposed subcutaneous structures like a tendon. The surrounding skin on the toes appears mildly erythematous.

**Wound Type:** Pressure Ulcer / Injury  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound appears to be a deep pressure injury located in the intergluteal cleft or sacral region. The base of the wound is obscured by a combination of yellow slough and dark, non-viable necrotic tissue, making it unstageable. There is significant erythema (redness) and purplish discoloration in the periwound skin, which is a sign of concern. The wound edges appear defined and possibly rolled (epibole).

**Wound Type:** Peristomal Complication (likely Ischemic Stoma with Mucocutaneous Separation/Ulceration)  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The most concerning feature is the dark, dusky color of the stoma, which is a critical sign of potential ischemia or necrosis. This requires immediate medical evaluation by a surgeon or a Wound, Ostomy, and Continence (WOC) nurse. There is a clear separation at the border between the stoma and the skin.
