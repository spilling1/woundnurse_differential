## Case: 2025-07-10-762
**User:** sampilling@higharc.com  
**Date:** 7/10/2025, 6:47:18 AM  
**Wound Type:** Surgical Wound  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound is a dehisced (opened) surgical incision site. The wound edges are not approximated and are macerated in some areas. There is significant swelling (edema) of the limb. The wound bed is covered in a mix of yellow slough, areas of red granulation tissue, and some active bleeding.

### Classification Process:

**Independent Classification:** Surgical Wound (95% confidence)  

**YOLO Status:** Disabled  

**Final Decision:** AI classified as Surgical Wound with 95% confidence

## Case: 2025-07-10-530
**User:** sampilling@higharc.com  
**Date:** 7/10/2025, 6:56:39 AM  
**Wound Type:** Traumatic Wound  
**Confidence:** 85%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound presents as a complex healing traumatic injury, possibly an abrasion or a burn. It has a large, adherent, dark scab or eschar covering most of the surface. The edges show signs of healing with new pink and white epithelial tissue forming. There is some redness (erythema) around the perimeter, which could indicate inflammation or a localized infection.

## Case: 2025-07-10-009
**User:** sampilling@higharc.com  
**Date:** 7/10/2025, 7:17:05 AM  
**Wound Type:** Traumatic Wound  
**Confidence:** 90%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound appears to be a healing skin graft or a complex repaired laceration. There are remnants of sutures visible. The wound bed has a mixed appearance with areas of both healthy healing tissue (epithelialization) and non-viable tissue (necrosis/scab), which may indicate a component of delayed healing.

**Wound Type:** Traumatic Wound  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
There are two distinct wound sites. The surrounding skin appears thin and fragile (dermatoporosis), which is common in older adults and predisposes to skin tears. The wounds have a glistening surface, suggesting recent cleaning or application of an ointment.
