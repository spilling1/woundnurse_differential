### AI Reasoning:
The confidence score is high due to the clear visual evidence. The location on the heel, a major bony prominence, is classic for a pressure ulcer. The wound demonstrates full-thickness tissue loss, and the base is obscured by slough and eschar, which defines it as Unstageable. However, the visible whitish, fibrous tissue is highly suggestive of exposed tendon, which would classify it as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer. The combination of these features makes the diagnosis highly certain. This is a critical wound requiring immediate medical intervention. This is a severe, full-thickness wound. The periwound skin appears erythematous (red) and there is evidence of dried blood around the wound margins. The depth of the wound and the exposure of underlying structures indicate significant tissue damage.

The location on a major bony prominence (heel), combined with the deep, crater-like appearance and full-thickness tissue loss exposing underlying structures, is a classic presentation of a Stage 4 pressure ulcer. The extensive necrotic eschar and slough also classify it as 'Unstageable' because the true depth cannot be fully visualized until debridement. The combination of these features makes pressure injury the most probable diagnosis. The wound has well-defined, rolled edges (epibole). The surrounding skin appears dry and flaky. There are signs of dried blood around the wound perimeter. The depth of the wound is significant, making it a severe injury.

### AI Reasoning:
The combination of location in the 'gaiter area' of the lower leg, significant edema, and signs of hemosiderin staining are classic clinical indicators for a venous stasis ulcer resulting from chronic venous insufficiency. The red, granular wound bed is consistent with a healing attempt, but the presence of slough and significant inflammation suggests a stalled or complicated healing process. The wound is located on a lower limb with significant edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) in the periwound skin. There is evidence of hemosiderin staining (brownish discoloration) further down the leg, and the skin on the heel appears dry. The wound bed is primarily red and granular, but has patches of yellow slough. The surrounding inflammation is significant and may indicate associated cellulitis.

**Wound Type:** Pressure Ulcer  
**Confidence:** 70%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The location on the heel, a major bony prominence, is the most common site for a pressure ulcer. The depth of the wound appears to extend into or through the subcutaneous tissue. The presence of significant slough and eschar obscures the full depth of the wound and visualization of the base, making 'Unstageable' the correct classification. If the base were fully visible and bone/tendon was exposed, it would be Stage 4. The combination of location and tissue types strongly supports a pressure-related etiology. Deep, crater-like wound with a well-defined border. The wound bed contains a mix of black eschar, yellow slough, and deep red/purple tissue. White, fibrous tissue visible in the wound bed is highly suspicious for exposed tendon or fascia. The surrounding skin is erythematous (red), dry, and scaly, with some dried blood superior to the wound.

**Date:** 7/11/2025, 7:27:03 AM  
**Wound Type:** Pressure Ulcer  
**Confidence:** 75%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The location on the heel, a major bony prominence, is a classic site for a pressure ulcer. The depth of the wound, indicating full-thickness tissue loss with exposure of underlying structures like tendon or bone, is characteristic of a Stage 4 pressure injury. The presence of slough and eschar obscuring parts of the wound bed also fits the criteria for an Unstageable pressure injury. The combination of these features strongly supports this diagnosis. This is a full-thickness wound with a deep, crater-like appearance. The wound bed contains a mix of black/purple necrotic eschar, yellow slough, and exposed white/pale tissue, which is likely tendon or bone. The wound edges are defined, and the immediate surrounding skin is erythematous (red). There is some dried blood on the skin superior to the wound.

**User:** sampilling@higharc.com  
**Date:** 7/11/2025, 7:29:57 AM  
**Wound Type:** Pressure Ulcer  
**Confidence:** 50%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound is located on the heel, a primary bony prominence, which is the most significant indicator for a pressure ulcer. The deep, crater-like presentation with extensive necrotic tissue (eschar) and slough is characteristic of a severe, full-thickness pressure injury. Wounds where the base is obscured by slough/eschar are classified as 'Unstageable' according to NPIAP guidelines. The ulcer is deep with a 'punched-out' appearance. The wound base is obscured by a combination of yellow slough and dark, black eschar (necrotic tissue). A whitish, fibrous structure, likely tendon, is visible through the slough. The surrounding skin appears dry and flaky. Given the presence of slough and eschar obscuring the full depth, the wound is Unstageable, but it is highly likely a Stage 4 injury underneath.

**Wound Type:** Pressure Ulcer  
**Confidence:** 70%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The location on the heel is a classic site for a pressure ulcer due to it being a major bony prominence. The appearance of a deep ulcer containing both eschar and slough is characteristic of an Unstageable pressure injury (where the base is obscured, but the underlying damage is likely Stage 3 or Stage 4). The depth of the wound further supports significant tissue loss from sustained pressure. Deep, crater-like ulcer with well-defined borders. The wound bed is obscured by a combination of black eschar (necrotic tissue) and yellow/tan slough. A whitish, fibrous structure, possibly an exposed tendon or fascia, is visible. The periwound skin is erythematous (red) and appears dry.

**Wound Type:** Pressure Ulcer  
**Confidence:** 90%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound's location on the heel, a major bony prominence, is a classic presentation for a pressure ulcer. The presence of extensive slough and eschar covering the base makes it Unstageable, as the full depth of tissue loss cannot be determined. The depth and necrotic nature are indicative of significant, prolonged pressure. Deep, full-thickness tissue loss with a large amount of black eschar and yellow slough obscuring the wound base. What appears to be tendon or fascia may be visible. The wound edges are defined, and the periwound skin shows erythema (redness).

### AI Reasoning:
The location on a primary bony prominence (heel) is the strongest indicator for a pressure injury. The deep, crater-like appearance with a bed obscured by slough and eschar is the classic presentation of an Unstageable Pressure Injury. This type of wound develops from sustained pressure and/or shear, common in individuals with limited mobility. A deep, circular wound located on the heel, a bony prominence. The wound edges are defined and inflamed. The wound bed is covered by a mix of non-viable tissue, making it impossible to assess the full depth visually.
