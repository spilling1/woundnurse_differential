**Wound Type:** Surgical Wound  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound is a dehisced (opened) surgical incision site. The wound edges are not approximated and are macerated in some areas. There is significant swelling (edema) of the limb. The wound bed is covered in a mix of yellow slough, areas of red granulation tissue, and some active bleeding.

### Classification Process:

**Independent Classification:** Surgical Wound (95% confidence)  

**YOLO Status:** Disabled  

**Final Decision:** AI classified as Surgical Wound with 95% confidence

## Case: 2025-07-10-530
**User:** sampilling@higharc.com  
**Date:** 7/10/2025, 6:56:39 AM  
**Wound Type:** Traumatic Wound  
**Confidence:** 85%  
**AI Model:** gemini-2.5-pro  
**Detection Method:** AI Vision  

### AI Reasoning:
The wound presents as a complex healing traumatic injury, possibly an abrasion or a burn. It has a large, adherent, dark scab or eschar covering most of the surface. The edges show signs of healing with new pink and white epithelial tissue forming. There is some redness (erythema) around the perimeter, which could indicate inflammation or a localized infection.

### Classification Process:

**Independent Classification:** Traumatic Wound (85% confidence)  

**YOLO Status:** Disabled  

**Final Decision:** AI classified as Traumatic Wound with 85% confidence
