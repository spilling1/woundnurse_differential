> Care Plan for Pressure Ulcer on the Sacrum (Stage 3) - For Family Caregivers
> 
> Below is a step-by-step care plan designed for you to effectively manage a pressure ulcer at home. Please follow this guide and consult a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation.
> 
> ### Cleaning Instructions
> 1. **Wash Your Hands**: Before and after wound care, thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water to prevent infection.
> 2. **Prepare the Area**: Make sure the area around the wound is clean. Use a soft cloth or paper towel to clean the surrounding skin gently.
> 3. **Gently Clean the Wound**: Use saline solution (saltwater) to rinse the wound. You can make your own by mixing a teaspoon of salt with two cups of boiled and cooled water. Pour or gently spray the solution over the wound. Do not scrub, as this can cause damage.
> 4. **Remove Debris**: If there are any loose pieces of dead tissue (necrosis), gently remove them with a pair of sanitised tweezers or a clean, gloved hand. 
> 
> ### Dressing Recommendations
> 1. **Apply Barrier Cream**: After cleaning, apply a thin layer of barrier cream to the skin around the wound to protect it from moisture and further injury.
> 2. **Choose the Right Dressing**: Use hydrocolloid or foam dressings, which are suitable for moderate exudate (fluid drainage) and help keep the wound moist. Adapt dressings that are large enough to cover the entire wound and some area around it.
> 3. **Secure the Dressing**: If the dressing doesnâ€™t have an adhesive border, use medical tape to secure it in place without too much pressure, which might damage the skin.
> 
> ### Frequency of Care
> - **Daily Care**: Change the dressing once a day or when it becomes saturated. Always check the wound for signs of infection during each dressing change.
> - **Monitor**: Look at the wound and the surrounding skin every time you change the dressing to ensure it is healing as expected.
> 
> ### Warning Signs
> Watch for the following signs, which could indicate worsening or complications:
> - Increased redness
> - Swelling
> - Pus or foul-smelling drainage
> - Fever
> - Blackened areas in the tissue
> 
> ### When to Contact Healthcare Provider
> - If you notice any of the warning signs above.
> - The wound is not improving or is getting worse after a week of home care.
> - The person with the ulcer develops a fever or chills.
> - The skin around the ulcer becomes more painful.
> - If you're uncertain about how to proceed or feel uncomfortable managing the wound.
> 
> ### Additional Tips for Caregivers
> - **Reposition Regularly**: Assist the person with the pressure ulcer to change positions frequently (at least every two hours) to relieve pressure on the area.
> - **Nutrition and Hydration**: Ensure they consume a balanced diet rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals, and keep them well-hydrated. Proper nutrition supports wound healing.
> - **Maintain a Clean Environment**: Ensure bedding is clean and dry. Change soiled or damp linens promptly to prevent skin irritation and infection.
> - **Protective Devices**: Consider using cushions or pillows to relieve pressure on the sacrum when seated or lying down.
> - **Educate Yourself**: Consider watching tutorials or attending workshops on wound care management.
> 
> By diligently following these guidelines, caregivers can contribute significantly to the healing process while ensuring comfort and reducing risks of further complications.
